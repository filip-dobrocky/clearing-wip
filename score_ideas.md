source: 
- 2 mics: 
    - geofon - bass - instrument body
    - akg c411 pp - violin/viola/cello/monochord bridge
- techniques:
    - col legno batuto - percussive pitched
    - beat on body - bass - percussive noise
    - bow on bridge - texture noise
    - bow harmonics - texture ~pitched 
    - bow ordinario - pitched
    - tremolo -> noise

processing:
- reso - noise to pitch, pitch transformation
- pitchshift - pitch transformation, granular texture
- destroyer - pitch to noise, harshness
- reverb - space
    - as fx send?
- spectral - static digital textures, interpolations

spatialization
- growing, shrinking - push
- rotate X, Y
    - above
- reverb?

form:
- transitions - pitch -> noise, noise -> pitch
    - by instrument and by processing
- growing, shrinking of sound field
- start with analog noisy texture, planewave
- loop, not right away

# I
- raw noisy texture
- transforming
    - 1. pitch shift
    - 2. resonator
    - 3. destroyer
    - 4. reverb
- growing in space
- auto RTT
- silence

# II
- layering of pitched sounds
- harmonics
- glissandos
- transforming
    - 1. pitch shift up
    - 2. push above
    
# III
- spectral

# IV
- chords
